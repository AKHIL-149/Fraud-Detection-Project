## Introduction
Financial fraud poses a significant threat to the global economy, with losses estimated to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Traditional fraud detection models often struggle to adapt to the rapidly evolving tactics employed by fraudsters. This project aims to develop an adaptive fraud detection model that continuously learns and updates itself with new data, ensuring its resilience against evolving fraud tactics.

### Objectives
- Develop an adaptive fraud detection model using machine learning techniques.
- Employ online learning algorithms and ensemble methods to capture evolving patterns.
- Incorporate concept drift detection mechanisms to maintain high accuracy.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time fraud detection.
